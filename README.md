## Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Sebastian

<b>Currently looking for an Internship, preferrably in Game-Development with a focus on Tools-Engineering or Generalist Programming</b>

I am currently a 5th semester bachelor Software-Engineering student of the University of Applied Sciences Upper Austria. Additionally I am currently working as a Junior Software Developer for Xortex E-Business GmbH with a focus on Framework-Development using PHP, TS, SCSS, Handlebars, MariaDB and more. <br><br>

My specialities lie in tool-development and maintenance of large, long-living systems.

I am currently working on both a small City Builder Project and my bachelors' thesis about inpainting methods in Realtime 3D environments using the Meta Passthrough and Depth-API.<br> 
If you are interested in my work, feel free to look through a few of my repositories.<br><br> 
Some of my repositories are private due to the universities regulations. In case you are interested in those, feel free to reach out. I'll either add your user to the repositories or send you credentials to another account which has access to all the repositories.

My Tech-Stack in general is rather versatile, going from the Languages I use in Web-Development for work, to more Low-Level languages like C, C++, but also Java and C#
