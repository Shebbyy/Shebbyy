## Hi there 👋, I'm Sebastian

I am currently a 5th semester bachelor Software-Engineering student of the University of Applied Sciences Upper Austria as well as a Junior Software Developer for the Xortex E-Business GmbH with a focus on CMS-Framework-Development using PHP, TS, SCSS, Handlebars, MariaDB and more. <br><br>

My specialities lie in tool-development, the maintenance and extension of large, long-living systems.

I am currently working on both a small City Builder Project and my bachelors' thesis about the evaluation of inpainting methods in Realtime for Augmented Reality, using Unity and the Meta Quest Passthrough API, in particular for decluttering environments<br> 
If you are interested in my work, feel free to look through a few of my repositories.<br><br> 
Some of my repositories are private due to the universities regulations. In case you are interested in those, feel free to reach out. I'll either add your user to the repositories or send you credentials to another account which has access to all the repositories.

My Tech-Stack in general is rather versatile, going from the Languages I use in Web-Development for work, to more Low-Level languages like C, C++, but also Java and C#

If you'd like to talk, feel free to reach out to me!
